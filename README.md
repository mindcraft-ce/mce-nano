> [!Note]
> This is a lightweight reimplementation of mindcraft, built from scratch designed to run on low-end hardware. It does not include most features present in [the community edition](https://github.com/mindcraft-ce/mindcraft-ce) or [the original mindcraft](https://github.com/mindcraft-bots/mindcraft).

The open-source platform for crafting intelligent, collaborative agents in Minecraft using Large Language Models.

## What is this about?

**mce-nano** is a lightweight, open-source platform for running intelligent, LLM-powered Minecraft bots using [mineflayer](https://prismarinejs.github.io/mineflayer/#/). It is designed for simplicity, low resource usage, and easy customization, making it ideal for running on low-end hardware, servers, or as a starting point for your own Minecraft AI experiments.

- **Minimalist**: No bloat, just the essentials for LLM-driven Minecraft automation.
- **Multi-Provider**: Supports OpenAI, Gemini, Andy API, Ollama, Pollinations, and more.
- **Configurable**: Each bot can have its own model, provider, and personality in config.yml.
- **Conversation-Aware**: Optionally saves and reloads conversation history per bot.
- **Docker-Ready**: Simple Dockerfile and docker-compose for easy deployment.
- **Community-Driven**: Maintained by contributors from the Mindcraft community.

## Requirements

- [Minecraft Java Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-pc) (up to v1.21.6)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/)
- (Optional) API key for your chosen LLM provider (see keys.example.json)
- (Optional) [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerized deployment

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mce-nano.git
   cd mce-nano
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Copy and edit your keys:**
   - Copy keys.example.json to keys.json and add your API keys (see FAQ for help).

4. **Edit your bot config:**
   - Edit config.yml to set up your bot(s), model, provider, and options.

5. **Start Minecraft and open to LAN** (default port: 55916).

6. **Run the bot:**
   ```sh
   node main.js
   ```
   Or use Docker:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## Configuration

- **Bots:** Each entry in config.yml under `bots:` defines a bot with its own username, model, provider, and options.
- **Providers:** Supported providers include OpenAI, Gemini, Andy API, Ollama, Pollinations, and more.
- **Conversation:** Enable `save_conversation: true` to persist chat history for each bot.
- **Interactive:** `idle_timeout_seconds` and `idle_message` can make the bot active when nothing is happening.

See the comments in config.yml for more details.

## Commands

Bots support a wide range of commands, including movement, inventory, crafting, and more. Commands are listed in prompt.txt.  
Example usage:  
`!goToPlayer("player_name", 2)`
